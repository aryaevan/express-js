# Klinik Pintar Coding Test

Welcome! Thanks for your interest in klinik pintar. 

We have 2 kinds of test related to our current tech stack. Feel free to pick one that suits you, assigned by our HR or do both if you're the ambitious-code-loving type of person ;)

Please note that there are no pressure to finish the test. We will discuss deeper in the interview and will give you time to update/finish/pair programming with us.

For both code challenge, we have simple frontend inside public/index.html - check the TODOs inside that file and finish as many as you can.

## Laravel code challenge (BO Challenge)

We have an old controller file in src/MedicineOutgoingController.php - this class is filled with tech debt and bugs.

Your task is to:
